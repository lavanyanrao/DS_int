       " \"What are we doing?\\nWe're updating the first million selling computer book, BASIC Computer Games, for 2021!\\nWhere can we discuss it?\\nPlease see the discussion here for a worklog and conversation around this project.\\nProject structure\\nI have moved all the original BASIC source code into a folder for each project in the original book (first volume). Note that Lyle Kopnicky has generously normalized all the code (thanks Lyle!) to run against Vintage Basic circa 2009:\\nI've included all the games here for your tinkering pleasure. I've tested and tweaked each one of them to make sure they'll run with Vintage BASIC, though you may see a few oddities. That's part of the fun of playing with BASIC: it never works quite the same on two machines. The games will play better if you keep CAPS LOCK on, as they were designed to be used with capital-letter input.\\nEach project has subfolders corresponding to the languages we'd like to see the games ported to. This is based on the February 2021 TIOBE index of top languages that are memory safe and general purpose scripting language per this post:\\nJava\\nPython\\nC#\\nVB.NET\\nJavaScript\\nRuby\\nDelphi / Object Pascal\\nPerl\\nProject goals\\nFeel free to begin converting these classic games into the above list of modern, memory safe languages. But first, a few guidelines:\\nThese are very old games. They date from the mid-70s so they're not exactly examples of what kids (or anyone, really?) would be playing these days. Consider them more like classic programming exercises to teach programming. We're paying it forward by converting them into modern languages, so the next generation can learn from the programs in this classic book -- and compare implementations across common modern languages.\\nStay true to the original program. These are mostly unsophisticated, simple command line / console games, so we should strive to replicate the command line / console output and behavior illustrated in the original book. See the README in the project folder for links to the original scanned source input and output. Avoid the impulse to add features; keep it simple.\\nPlease DO update for modern coding conventions. Support uppercase and lowercase. Use structured programming. Use subroutines. Try to be an example of good, modern coding practices!\\nUse lots of comments to explain what is going on. Comment liberally! If there were clever tricks in the original code, decompose those tricks into simpler (even if more verbose) code, and use comments to explain what's happening and why.\\nDon't get too fancy. Definitely use the most recent versions and features of the target language, but also try to keep the code samples simple and explainable -- the goal is to teach programming in the target language, not necessarily demonstrate the cleverest one-line tricks.\\nHave fun!\\nThank you for taking part in this project to update a classic programming book -- one of the most influential programming books in computing history -- for 2021!\",\n",
       " \"Ghidra Software Reverse Engineering Framework\\nGhidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework created and maintained by the National Security Agency Research Directorate. This framework includes a suite of full-featured, high-end software analysis tools that enable users to analyze compiled code on a variety of platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Capabilities include disassembly, assembly, decompilation, graphing, and scripting, along with hundreds of other features. Ghidra supports a wide variety of processor instruction sets and executable formats and can be run in both user-interactive and automated modes. Users may also develop their own Ghidra plug-in components and/or scripts using Java or Python.\\nIn support of NSA's Cybersecurity mission, Ghidra was built to solve scaling and teaming problems on complex SRE efforts, and to provide a customizable and extensible SRE research platform. NSA has applied Ghidra SRE capabilities to a variety of problems that involve analyzing malicious code and generating deep insights for SRE analysts who seek a better understanding of potential vulnerabilities in networks and systems.\\nTo start developing extensions and scripts, try out the GhidraDev plugin for Eclipse, which is part of the distribution package.

       " \"Creating equitable access to the global financial system\\nStellar Go Monorepo\\nThis repo is the home for all of the public Go code produced by the Stellar Development Foundation.\\nThis repo contains various tools and services that you can use and deploy, as well as the SDK you can use to develop applications that integrate with the Stellar network.\\nPackage Index\\nHorizon Server: Full-featured API server for Stellar network\\nGo Horizon SDK - horizonclient: Client for Horizon server (queries and transaction submission)\\nGo Horizon SDK - txnbuild: Construct Stellar transactions and operations\\nTicker: An API server that provides statistics about assets and markets on the Stellar network\\nKeystore: An API server that is used to store and manage encrypted keys for Stellar client applications\\nServers for Anchors & Financial Institutions\\nCompliance Server: Allows financial institutions to exchange KYC information\\nFederation Server: Allows organizations to provide addresses for users (jane*examplebank.com)\\nDependencies\\nThis repository is officially supported on the last two releases of Go, which is currently Go 1.14 and Go 1.15.\\nIt depends on a number of external dependencies, and uses Go Modules to manage them. Running any go command will automatically download dependencies required for that operation.\\nYou can choose to checkout this repository into a GOPATH or into any directory.\\nDirectory Layout\\nIn addition to the other top-level packages, there are a few special directories that contain specific types of packages:\\nclients contains packages that provide client packages to the various Stellar services.\\nexp contains experimental packages. Use at your own risk.\\nhandlers contains packages that provide pluggable implementors of http.Handler that make it easier to incorporate portions of the Stellar protocol into your own http server.\\nsupport contains packages that are not intended for consumption outside of Stellar's other packages. Packages that provide common infrastructure for use in our services and tools should go here, such as db or log.\\nsupport/scripts contains single-file go programs and bash scripts used to support the development of this repo.\\nservices contains packages that compile to applications that are long-running processes (such as API servers).\\ntools contains packages that compile to command line applications.\\nEach of these directories have their own README file that explain further the nature of their contents.\\nOther packages\\nIn addition to the packages described above, this repository contains various packages related to working with the Stellar network from a go program. It's recommended that you use godoc to browse the documentation for each.\\nPackage source layout\\nWhile much of the code in individual packages is organized based upon different developers' personal preferences, many of the packages follow a simple convention for organizing the declarations inside of a package that aim to aid in your ability to find code.\\nIn each package, there may be one or more of a set of common files:\\nerrors.go: This file should contains declarations (both types and vars) for errors that are used by the package.\\nexample_test.go: This file should contains example tests, as described at https://blog.golang.org/examples.\\nmain.go/internal.go (deprecated): Older packages may have a main.go (public symbols) or internal.go (private symbols). These files contain, respectively, the exported and unexported vars, consts, types and funcs for the package. New packages do not follow this pattern, and instead follow the standard Go convention to co-locate structs and their methods in the same files.\\nmain.go (new convention): If present, this file contains a main function as part of an executable main package.\\nIn addition to the above files, a package often has files that contains code that is specific to one declared type. This file uses the snake case form of the type name (for example loggly_hook.go would correspond to the type LogglyHook). This file should contain method declarations, interface implementation assertions and any other declarations that are tied solely to that type.\\nEach non-test file can have a test counterpart like normal, whose name ends with _test.go. The common files described above also have their own test counterparts... for example internal_test.go should contains tests that test unexported behavior and more commonly test helpers that are unexported.\\nGenerally, file contents are sorted by exported/unexported, then declaration type (ordered as consts, vars, types, then funcs), then finally alphabetically.\\nTest helpers\\nOften, we provide test packages that aid in the creation of tests that interact with our other packages. For example, the support/db package has the support/db/dbtest package underneath it that contains elements that make it easier to test code that accesses a SQL database. We've found that this pattern of having a separate test package maximizes flexibility and simplifies package dependencies.\\nContributing\\nContributions are welcome!

We are thinking of best practices. We will try to improve testing, preview and build by using Fake. For example, this app allows you to interact with the Android Studio Preview as if it were a real app.\\nThis is possible by creating a Fake ViewModel and making it reliable.\\nHow to make Fake\\'s ViewModel reliable\\nDo the same test for Fake and the real thing by testing against the interface. This makes Fake\\'s ViewModel reliable. This technique of doing the same test against Fake was introduced in \"Build testable apps for Android\" session(Google I/O\\'19).\\nYou can also prevent forgetting to update by forcing the implementation with interface and .

In that case, the required task is :uicomponent-compose:main:compileDebugKotlin. Therefore, there is no need to build the data module that contains the definitions such as API and the build of Android dex, so you can quickly build and check. Also, changes to the data layer do not affect the ui module, so you can build faster.\\nOverall architecture\\nThanks\\nThank you for contributing!\\nContributors\\nGitHub : Contributors\\nDesigner\\nnontan\\nTrouble Shooting\\nAndroid Gradle plugin requires Java 11 to run.

You can open any of these Xcode projects to see an example of how the Adjust SDK can be integrated.\\nBasic integration\\nWe will describe the steps to integrate the Adjust SDK into your iOS project. We are going to assume that you are using Xcode for your iOS development.\\nAdd the SDK to your project\\nIf you\\'re using CocoaPods, you can add the following line to your Podfile and continue from this step:\\npod \\'Adjust\\', \\'~> 4.26.1\\'\\nor:\\npod \\'Adjust\\', :git => \\'https://github.com/adjust/ios_sdk.git\\', :tag => \\'v4.26.1\\'\\nIf you\\'re using Carthage, you can add following line to your Cartfile and continue from this step:\\ngithub \"adjust/ios_sdk\"\\nIf you\\'re using Swift Package Manager, you can add the repository address directly in Xcode going to File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency and continue from this step:\\nhttps://github.com/adjust/ios_sdk\\nYou can also choose to integrate the Adjust SDK by adding it to your project as a framework. On the releases page you can find the following archives:\\nAdjustSdkStatic.framework.zip\\nAdjustSdkDynamic.framework.zip\\nAdjustSdkTv.framework.zip\\nAdjustSdkIm.framework.zip\\nSince the release of iOS 8, Apple has introduced dynamic frameworks (also known as embedded frameworks). If your app is targeting iOS 8 or higher, you can use the Adjust SDK dynamic framework. Choose which framework you want to use – static or dynamic – and add it to your project.\\nIf you are having tvOS app, you can use the Adjust SDK with it as well with usage of our tvOS framework which you can extract from AdjustSdkTv.framework.zip archive.\\nIf you are having iMessage app, you can use the Adjust SDK with it as well with usage of our IM framework which you can extract from AdjustSdkIm.framework.zip archive.\\nAdd iOS frameworks\\nAdjust SDK is able to get additional information in case you link additional iOS frameworks to your app. Please, add following frameworks in case you want to enable Adjust SDK features based on their presence in your app and mark them as optional:\\nAdSupport.framework - This framework is needed so that SDK can access to IDFA value and (prior to iOS 14) LAT information.\\niAd.framework - This framework is needed so that SDK can automatically handle attribution for ASA campaings you might be running (to be deprecated in the future in favour of AdServices.framework).\\nAdServices.framework - This framework is needed so that SDK can automatically handle attribution for ASA campaings you might be running.\\nCoreTelephony.framework - This framework is needed so that SDK can determine current radio access technology.\\nStoreKit.framework - This framework is needed for access to SKAdNetwork framework and for Adjust SDK to handle communication with it automatically in iOS 14 or later.\\nAppTrackingTransparency.framework - This framework is needed in iOS 14 and later for SDK to be able to wrap user\\'s tracking consent dialog and access to value of the user\\'s consent to be tracked or not.\\nIntegrate the SDK into your app\\nIf you added the Adjust SDK via a Pod repository, you should use one of the following import statements:\\n#import \"Adjust.h\"\\nor\\n#import <Adjust/Adjust.h>\\nIf you added the Adjust SDK as a static/dynamic framework or via Carthage, you should use the following import statement:\\n#import <AdjustSdk/Adjust.h>\\nIf you are are using the Adjust SDK with your tvOS app, you should use the following import statement:\\n#import <AdjustSdkTv/Adjust.h>\\nIf you are are using the Adjust SDK with your iMessage app, you should use the following import statement:\\n#import <AdjustSdkIm/Adjust.h>\\nNext, we\\'ll set up basic session tracking.\\nBasic setup\\nIn the Project Navigator, open the source file of your application delegate. Add the import statement at the top of the file, then add the following call to Adjust in the didFinishLaunching or didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method of your app delegate:\\n#import \"Adjust.h\"\\n// or #import <Adjust/Adjust.h>\\n// or #import <AdjustSdk/Adjust.h>\\n// or #import <AdjustSdkTv/Adjust.h>\\n// or #import <AdjustSdkIm/Adjust.h>\\n\\n// ...\\n\\nNSString *yourAppToken = @\"{YourAppToken}\";\\nNSString *environment = ADJEnvironmentSandbox;\\nADJConfig *adjustConfig = [ADJConfig configWithAppToken:yourAppToken\\n                                            environment:environment];\\n\\n[Adjust appDidLaunch:adjustConfig];\\nNote: Initialising the Adjust SDK like this is very important. Otherwise, you may encounter different kinds of issues as described in our troubleshooting section.\\nReplace {YourAppToken} with your app token. You can find this in your dashboard.\\nDepending on whether you build your app for testing or for production, you must set environment with one of these values:\\nNSString *environment = ADJEnvironmentSandbox;\\nNSString *environment = ADJEnvironmentProduction;\\nImportant: This value should be set to ADJEnvironmentSandbox if and only if you or someone else is testing your app. Make sure to set the environment to ADJEnvironmentProduction just before you publish the app. Set it back to ADJEnvironmentSandbox when you start developing and testing it again.\\nWe use this environment to distinguish between real traffic and test traffic from test devices. It is very important that you keep this value meaningful at all times! This is especially important if you are tracking revenue.\\niMessage specific setup\\nAdding SDK from source: In case that you have chosen to add Adjust SDK to your iMessage app from source, please make sure that you have pre-processor macro ADJUST_IM=1 set in your iMessage project settings.\\nAdding SDK as framework: After you have added AdjustSdkIm.framework to your iMessage app, please make sure to add New Copy Files Phase in your Build Phases project settings and select that AdjustSdkIm.framework should be copied to Frameworks folder.\\nSession tracking: If you would like to have session tracking properly working in your iMessage app, you will need to do one additional integration step. In standard iOS apps Adjust SDK is automatically subscribed to iOS system notifications which enable us to know when app entered or left foreground. In case of iMessage app, this is not the case, so we need you to add explicit calls to trackSubsessionStart and trackSubsessionEnd methods inside of your iMessage app view controller to make our SDK aware of the moments when your app is being in foreground or not.\\nAdd call to trackSubsessionStart inside of didBecomeActiveWithConversation: method:\\n-(void)didBecomeActiveWithConversation:(MSConversation *)conversation {\\n    // Called when the extension is about to move from the inactive to active state.\\n    // This will happen when the extension is about to present UI.\\n    // Use this method to configure the extension and restore previously stored state.\\n\\n    [Adjust trackSubsessionStart];\\n}\\nAdd call to trackSubsessionEnd inside of willResignActiveWithConversation: method:\\n-(void)willResignActiveWithConversation:(MSConversation *)conversation {\\n    // Called when the extension is about to move from the active to inactive state.\\n    // This will happen when the user dissmises the extension, changes to a different\\n    // conversation or quits Messages.\\n    \\n    // Use this method to release shared resources, save user data, invalidate timers,\\n    // and store enough state information to restore your extension to its current state\\n    // in case it is terminated later.\\n\\n    [Adjust trackSubsessionEnd];\\n}\\nWith this set, Adjust SDK will be able to successfully perform session tracking inside of your iMessage app.\\nNote: You should be aware that your iOS app and iMessage extension you wrote for it are running in different memory spaces and they as well have different bundle identifiers. Initialising Adjust SDK with same app token in both places will result in two independent instances tracking things unaware of each other which might cause data mixture you don\\'t want to see in your dashboard data. General advice would be to create separate app in Adjust dashboard for your iMessage app and initialise SDK inside of it with separate app token.\\nAdjust logging\\nYou can increase or decrease the amount of logs that you see during testing by calling setLogLevel: on your ADJConfig instance with one of the following parameters:\\n[adjustConfig setLogLevel:ADJLogLevelVerbose];  // enable all logging\\n[adjustConfig setLogLevel:ADJLogLevelDebug];    // enable more logging\\n[adjustConfig setLogLevel:ADJLogLevelInfo];     // the default\\n[adjustConfig setLogLevel:ADJLogLevelWarn];     // disable info logging\\n[adjustConfig setLogLevel:ADJLogLevelError];    // disable warnings as well\\n[adjustConfig setLogLevel:ADJLogLevelAssert];   // disable errors as well\\n[adjustConfig setLogLevel:ADJLogLevelSuppress]; // disable all logging\\nIf you don\\'t want your app in production to display any logs coming from the Adjust SDK, then you should select ADJLogLevelSuppress and in addition to that, initialise ADJConfig object with another constructor where you should enable suppress log level mode:\\n#import \"Adjust.h\"\\n// or #import <Adjust/Adjust.h>\\n// or #import <AdjustSdk/Adjust.h>\\n// or #import <AdjustSdkTv/Adjust.h>\\n// or #import <AdjustSdkIm/Adjust.h>\\n\\n// ...\\n\\nNSString *yourAppToken = @\"{YourAppToken}\";\\nNSString *environment = ADJEnvironmentSandbox;\\nADJConfig *adjustConfig = [ADJConfig configWithAppToken:yourAppToken\\n                                            environment:environment\\n                                   allowSuppressLogLevel:YES];\\n\\n[Adjust appDidLaunch:adjustConfig];\\nBuild your app\\nBuild and run your app. If the build succeeds, you should carefully read the SDK logs in the console. After the app launches for the first time, you should see the info log Install tracked.\\nAdditional features\\nOnce you integrate the Adjust SDK into your project, you can take advantage of the following features.\\nAppTrackingTransparency framework\\nFor each package sent, the Adjust backend receives one of the following four (4) states of consent for access to app-related data that can be used for tracking the user or the device:\\nAuthorized\\nDenied\\nNot Determined\\nRestricted\\nAfter a device receives an authorization request to approve access to app-related data, which is used for user device tracking, the returned status will either be Authorized or Denied.\\nBefore a device receives an authorization request for access to app-related data, which is used for tracking the user or device, the returned status will be Not Determined.\\nIf authorization to use app tracking data is restricted, the returned status will be Restricted.\\nThe SDK has a built-in mechanism to receive an updated status after a user responds to the pop-up dialog, in case you don\\'t want to customize your displayed dialog pop-up. To conveniently and efficiently communicate the new state of consent to the backend, Adjust SDK offers a wrapper around the app tracking authorization method described in the following chapter, App-tracking authorization wrapper.\\nApp-tracking authorisation wrapper\\nAdjust SDK offers the possibility to use it for requesting user authorization in accessing their app-related data. Adjust SDK has a wrapper built on top of the requestTrackingAuthorizationWithCompletionHandler: method, where you can as well define the callback method to get information about a user\\'s choice. Also, with the use of this wrapper, as soon as a user responds to the pop-up dialog, it\\'s then communicated back using your callback method. The SDK will also inform the backend of the user\\'s choice. The NSUInteger value will be delivered via your callback method with the following meaning:\\n0: ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined\\n1: ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusRestricted\\n2: ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusDenied\\n3: ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusAuthorized\\nTo use this wrapper, you can call it as such:\\n[Adjust requestTrackingAuthorizationWithCompletionHandler:^(NSUInteger status) {\\n    switch (status) {\\n        case 0:\\n            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined case\\n            break;\\n        case 1:\\n            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusRestricted case\\n            break;\\n        case 2:\\n            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusDenied case\\n            break;\\n        case 3:\\n            // ATTrackingManagerAuthorizationStatusAuthorized case\\n            break;\\n    }\\n}];\\nGet current authorisation status\\nTo get the current app tracking authorization status you can call [Adjust appTrackingAuthorizationStatus] that will return one of the following possibilities:\\n0: The user hasn\\'t been asked yet\\n1: The user device is restricted\\n2: The user denied access to IDFA\\n3: The user authorized access to IDFA\\n-1: The status is not available\\nSKAdNetwork framework\\nIf you have implemented the Adjust iOS SDK v4.23.0 or above and your app is running on iOS 14, the communication with SKAdNetwork will be set on by default, although you can choose to turn it off. When set on, Adjust automatically registers for SKAdNetwork attribution when the SDK is initialized. If events are set up in the Adjust dashboard to receive conversion values, the Adjust backend sends the conversion value data to the SDK. The SDK then sets the conversion value. After Adjust receives the SKAdNetwork callback data, it is then displayed in the dashboard.\\nIn case you don\\'t want the Adjust SDK to automatically communicate with SKAdNetwork, you can disable that by calling the following method on configuration object:\\n[adjustConfig deactivateSKAdNetworkHandling];\\nUpdate SKAdNetwork conversion value\\nAs of iOS SDK v4.26.0 you can use Adjust SDK wrapper method updateConversionValue: to update SKAdNetwork conversion value for your user:\\n[Adjust updateConversionValue:6];\\nEvent tracking\\nYou can use adjust to track events. Lets say you want to track every tap on a particular button. You would create a new event token in your dashboard, which has an associated event token - looking something like abc123. In your button\\'s buttonDown method you would then add the following lines to track the tap:\\nADJEvent *event = [ADJEvent eventWithEventToken:@\"abc123\"];\\n[Adjust trackEvent:event];\\nWhen tapping the button you should now see Event tracked in the logs.\\nThe event instance can be used to configure the event further before tracking it:\\nRevenue tracking\\nIf your users can generate revenue by tapping on advertisements or making in-app purchases you can track those revenues with events. Lets say a tap is worth one Euro cent. You could then track the revenue event like this:\\nADJEvent *event = [ADJEvent eventWithEventToken:@\"abc123\"];\\n\\n[event setRevenue:0.01 currency:@\"EUR\"];\\n\\n[Adjust trackEvent:event];\\nThis can be combined with callback parameters of course.\\nWhen you set a currency token, adjust will automatically convert the incoming revenues into a reporting revenue of your choice. Read more about currency conversion here.\\nYou can read more about revenue and event tracking in the event tracking guide.\\nRevenue deduplication\\nYou can also pass in an optional transaction ID to avoid tracking duplicate revenues. The last ten transaction IDs are remembered and revenue events with duplicate transaction IDs are skipped. This is especially useful for in-app purchase tracking. See an example below.\\nIf you want to track in-app purchases, please make sure to call trackEvent after finishTransaction in paymentQueue:updatedTransactions only if the state changed to SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased. That way you can avoid tracking revenue that is not actually being generated.\\n- (void)paymentQueue:(SKPaymentQueue *)queue updatedTransactions:(NSArray *)transactions {\\n    for (SKPaymentTransaction *transaction in transactions) {\\n        switch (transaction.transactionState) {\\n            case SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased:\\n                [self finishTransaction:transaction];\\n\\n                ADJEvent *event = [ADJEvent eventWithEventToken:...];\\n                [event setRevenue:... currency:...];\\n                [event setTransactionId:transaction.transactionIdentifier]; // avoid duplicates\\n                [Adjust trackEvent:event];\\n\\n                break;\\n            // more cases\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\nIn-App Purchase verification\\nIf you want to check the validity of In-App Purchases made in your app using Purchase Verification, adjust\\'s server side receipt verification tool, then check out our iOS purchase SDK and read more about it here.\\nCallback parameters\\nYou can register a callback URL for your events in your dashboard. We will send a GET request to that URL whenever the event is tracked. You can add callback parameters to that event by calling addCallbackParameter to the event before tracking it. We will then append these parameters to your callback URL.\\nFor example, suppose you have registered the URL http://www.mydomain.com/callback then track an event like this:\\nADJEvent *event = [ADJEvent eventWithEventToken:@\"abc123\"];\\n\\n[event addCallbackParameter:@\"key\" value:@\"value\"];\\n[event addCallbackParameter:@\"foo\" value:@\"bar\"];\\n\\n[Adjust trackEvent:event];\\nIn that case we would track the event and send a request to:\\nhttp://www.mydomain.com/callback?key=value&foo=bar\\nIt should be mentioned that we support a variety of placeholders like {idfa} that can be used as parameter values. In the resulting callback this placeholder would be replaced with the ID for Advertisers of the current device. Also note that we don\\'t store any of your custom parameters, but only append them to your callbacks, thus without a callback they will not be saved nor sent to you.\\nYou can read more about using URL callbacks, including a full list of available values, in our callbacks guide.\\nPartner parameters\\nYou can also add parameters to be transmitted to network partners, which have been activated in your Adjust dashboard.\\nThis works similarly to the callback parameters mentioned above, but can be added by calling the addPartnerParameter method on your ADJEvent instance.\\nADJEvent *event = [ADJEvent eventWithEventToken:@\"abc123\"];\\n\\n[event addPartnerParameter:@\"key\" value:@\"value\"];\\n[event addPartnerParameter:@\"foo\" value:@\"bar\"];\\n\\n[Adjust trackEvent:event];\\nYou can read more about special partners and these integrations in our guide to special partners.\\nCallback identifier\\nYou can also add custom string identifier to each event you want to track. This identifier will later be reported in event success and/or event failure callbacks to enable you to keep track on which event was successfully tracked or not. You can set this identifier by calling the setCallbackId method on your ADJEvent instance:\\nADJEvent *event = [ADJEvent eventWithEventToken:@\"abc123\"];\\n\\n[event setCallbackId:@\"Your-Custom-Id\"];\\n\\n[Adjust trackEvent:event];\\nSession parameters\\nSome parameters are saved to be sent in every event and session of the Adjust SDK. Once you have added any of these parameters, you don\\'t need to add them every time, since they will be saved locally. If you add the same parameter twice, there will be no effect.\\nIf you want to send session parameters with the initial install event, they must be called before the Adjust SDK launches via [Adjust appDidLaunch:]. If you need to send them with an install, but can only obtain the needed values after launch, it\\'s possible to delay the first launch of the Adjust SDK to allow this behavior.\\nSession callback parameters\\nThe same callback parameters that are registered for events can be also saved to be sent in every event or session of the Adjust SDK.\\nThe session callback parameters have a similar interface of the event callback parameters. Instead of adding the key and it\\'s value to an event, it\\'s added through a call to Adjust method addSessionCallbackParameter:value::\\n[Adjust addSessionCallbackParameter:@\"foo\" value:@\"bar\"];\\nThe session callback parameters will be merged with the callback parameters added to an event. The callback parameters added to an event have precedence over the session callback parameters. Meaning that, when adding a callback parameter to an event with the same key to one added from the session, the value that prevails is the callback parameter added to the event.\\nIt\\'s possible to remove a specific session callback parameter by passing the desiring key to the method removeSessionCallbackParameter.\\n[Adjust removeSessionCallbackParameter:@\"foo\"];\\nIf you wish to remove all key and values from the session callback parameters, you can reset it with the method resetSessionCallbackParameters.\\n[Adjust resetSessionCallbackParameters];\\nSession partner parameters\\nIn the same way that there is session callback parameters that are sent every in event or session of the Adjust SDK, there is also session partner parameters.\\nThese will be transmitted to network partners, for the integrations that have been activated in your adjust dashboard.\\nThe session partner parameters have a similar interface to the event partner parameters. Instead of adding the key and it\\'s value to an event, it\\'s added through a call to Adjust method addSessionPartnerParameter:value::\\n[Adjust addSessionPartnerParameter:@\"foo\" value:@\"bar\"];\\nThe session partner parameters will be merged with the partner parameters added to an event. The partner parameters added to an event have precedence over the session partner parameters. Meaning that, when adding a partner parameter to an event with the same key to one added from the session, the value that prevails is the partner parameter added to the event.\\nIt\\'s possible to remove a specific session partner parameter by passing the desiring key to the method removeSessionPartnerParameter.\\n[Adjust removeSessionPartnerParameter:@\"foo\"];\\nIf you wish to remove all key and values from the session partner parameters, you can reset it with the method resetSessionPartnerParameters.\\n[Adjust resetSessionPartnerParameters];\\nDelay start\\nDelaying the start of the Adjust SDK allows your app some time to obtain session parameters, such as unique identifiers, to be send on install.\\nSet the initial delay time in seconds with the method setDelayStart in the ADJConfig instance:\\n[adjustConfig setDelayStart:5.5];\\nIn this case this will make the Adjust SDK not send the initial install session and any event created for 5.5 seconds. After this time is expired or if you call [Adjust sendFirstPackages] in the meanwhile, every session parameter will be added to the delayed install session and events and the Adjust SDK will resume as usual.\\nThe maximum delay start time of the Adjust SDK is 10 seconds.\\nAttribution callback\\nYou can register a delegate callback to be notified of tracker attribution changes. Due to the different sources considered for attribution, this information can not be provided synchronously. Follow these steps to implement the optional delegate protocol in your app delegate:\\nPlease make sure to consider our applicable attribution data policies.\\nOpen AppDelegate.h and add the import and the AdjustDelegate declaration.\\n@interface AppDelegate : UIResponder <UIApplicationDelegate, AdjustDelegate>\\nOpen AppDelegate.m and add the following delegate callback function to your app delegate implementation.\\n- (void)adjustAttributionChanged:(ADJAttribution *)attribution {\\n}\\nSet the delegate with your ADJConfig instance:\\n[adjustConfig setDelegate:self];\\nAs the delegate callback is configured using the ADJConfig instance, you should call setDelegate before calling [Adjust appDidLaunch:adjustConfig].\\nThe delegate function will be called after the SDK receives the final attribution data. Within the delegate function you have access to the attribution parameter. Here is a quick summary of its properties:\\nNSString trackerToken the tracker token of the current attribution.\\nNSString trackerName the tracker name of the current attribution.\\nNSString network the network grouping level of the current attribution.\\nNSString campaign the campaign grouping level of the current attribution.\\nNSString adgroup the ad group grouping level of the current attribution.\\nNSString creative the creative grouping level of the current attribution.\\nNSString clickLabel the click label of the current attribution.\\nNSString adid the unique device identifier provided by attribution.\\nNSString costType the cost type string.\\nNSNumber costAmount the cost amount.\\nNSString costCurrency the cost currency string.\\nIf any value is unavailable, it will default to nil.\\nNote: The cost data - costType, costAmount & costCurrency are only available when configured in ADJConfig by calling setNeedsCost: method. If not configured or configured, but not being part of the attribution, these fields will have value nil. This feature is available in SDK v4.24.0 and above.\\nAd revenue tracking\\nYou can track ad revenue information with Adjust SDK by invoking following method:\\n[Adjust trackAdRevenue:source payload:payload];\\nParameters of the method which you need to pass are:\\nsource - NSString object which indicates the source of ad revenue info.\\npayload - NSData object which contains ad revenue JSON.\\nCurrently we support the below source parameter values:\\nADJAdRevenueSourceMopub - representing MoPub mediation platform (for more information, check integration guide)\\nSubscription tracking\\nNote: This feature is only available in the native SDK v4.22.0 and above. We recommend using at least version 4.22.1.\\nImportant: The following steps only set up subscription tracking within the SDK. To complete setup, certain app-specific information must be added within Adjust’s internal interface. An Adjust representative must take this action: please contact support@adjust.com or your Technical Account Manager.\\nYou can track App Store subscriptions and verify their validity with the Adjust SDK. After a subscription has been successfully purchased, make the following call to the Adjust SDK:\\nADJSubscription *subscription = [[ADJSubscription alloc] initWithPrice:price\\n                                                              currency:currency\\n                                                         transactionId:transactionId\\n                                                            andReceipt:receipt];\\n[subscription setTransactionDate:transactionDate];\\n[subscription setSalesRegion:salesRegion];\\n\\n[Adjust trackSubscription:subscription];\\nOnly do this when the state has changed to SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased or SKPaymentTransactionStateRestored. Then make a call to finishTransaction in paymentQueue:updatedTransactions .\\nSubscription tracking parameters:\\nprice\\ncurrency (you need to pass currencyCode of the priceLocale object)\\ntransactionId\\nreceipt\\ntransactionDate\\nsalesRegion (you need to pass countryCode of the priceLocale object)\\nJust like with event tracking, you can attach callback and partner parameters to the subscription object as well:\\nADJSubscription *subscription = [[ADJSubscription alloc] initWithPrice:price\\n                                                              currency:currency\\n                                                         transactionId:transactionId\\n                                                            andReceipt:receipt];\\n[subscription setTransactionDate:transactionDate];\\n[subscription setSalesRegion:salesRegion];\\n\\n// add callback parameters\\n[subscription addCallbackParameter:@\"key\" value:@\"value\"];\\n[subscription addCallbackParameter:@\"foo\" value:@\"bar\"];\\n\\n// add partner parameters\\n[subscription addPartnerParameter:@\"key\" value:@\"value\"];\\n[subscription addPartnerParameter:@\"foo\" value:@\"bar\"];\\n\\n[Adjust trackSubscription:subscription];\\nEvent and session callbacks\\nYou can register a delegate callback to be notified of successful and failed tracked events and/or sessions. The same optional protocol AdjustDelegate used for the attribution callback is used.\\nFollow the same steps and implement the following delegate callback function for successful tracked events:\\n- (void)adjustEventTrackingSucceeded:(ADJEventSuccess *)eventSuccessResponseData {\\n}\\nThe following delegate callback function for failed tracked events:\\n- (void)adjustEventTrackingFailed:(ADJEventFailure *)eventFailureResponseData {\\n}\\nFor successful tracked sessions:\\n- (void)adjustSessionTrackingSucceeded:(ADJSessionSuccess *)sessionSuccessResponseData {\\n}\\nAnd for failed tracked sessions:\\n- (void)adjustSessionTrackingFailed:(ADJSessionFailure *)sessionFailureResponseData {\\n}\\nThe delegate functions will be called after the SDK tries to send a package to the server. Within the delegate callback you have access to a response data object specifically for the delegate callback. Here is a quick summary of the session response data properties:\\nNSString message the message from the server or the error logged by the SDK.\\nNSString timeStamp timestamp from the server.\\nNSString adid a unique device identifier provided by adjust.\\nNSDictionary jsonResponse the JSON object with the response from the server.\\nBoth event response data objects contain:\\nNSString eventToken the event token, if the package tracked was an event.\\nNSString callbackId the custom defined callback ID set on event object.\\nIf any value is unavailable, it will default to nil.\\nAnd both event and session failed objects also contain:\\nBOOL willRetry indicates that there will be an attempt to resend the package at a later time.\\nDisable tracking\\nYou can disable the Adjust SDK from tracking any activities of the current device by calling setEnabled with parameter NO. This setting is remembered between sessions.\\n[Adjust setEnabled:NO];\\nYou can check if the Adjust SDK is currently enabled by calling the function isEnabled. It is always possible to activate the Adjust SDK by invoking setEnabled with the enabled parameter as YES.\\nOffline mode\\nYou can put the Adjust SDK in offline mode to suspend transmission to our servers while retaining tracked data to be sent later. While in offline mode, all information is saved in a file, so be careful not to trigger too many events while in offline mode.\\nYou can activate offline mode by calling setOfflineMode with the parameter YES.\\n[Adjust setOfflineMode:YES];\\nConversely, you can deactivate offline mode by calling setOfflineMode with NO. When the Adjust SDK is put back in online mode, all saved information is sent to our servers with the correct time information.\\nUnlike disabling tracking, this setting is not remembered bettween sessions. This means that the SDK is in online mode whenever it is started, even if the app was terminated in offline mode.\\nEvent buffering\\nIf your app makes heavy use of event tracking, you might want to delay some HTTP requests in order to send them in one batch every minute. You can enable event buffering with your ADJConfig instance:\\n[adjustConfig setEventBufferingEnabled:YES];\\nIf nothing is set, event buffering is disabled by default.\\nGDPR right to be forgotten\\nIn accordance with article 17 of the EU\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you can notify Adjust when a user has exercised their right to be forgotten. Calling the following method will instruct the Adjust SDK to communicate the user\\'s choice to be forgotten to the Adjust backend:\\n[Adjust gdprForgetMe];\\nUpon receiving this information, Adjust will erase the user\\'s data and the Adjust SDK will stop tracking the user. No requests from this device will be sent to Adjust in the future.\\nThird-party sharing for specific users\\nYou can notify Adjust when a user disables, enables, and re-enables data sharing with third-party partners.\\nDisable third-party sharing for specific users\\nCall the following method to instruct the Adjust SDK to communicate the user\\'s choice to disable data sharing to the Adjust backend:\\nADJThirdPartySharing *adjustThirdPartySharing = [[ADJThirdPartySharing alloc] initWithIsEnabledNumberBool:@NO];\\n[Adjust trackThirdPartySharing:adjustThirdPartySharing];\\nUpon receiving this information, Adjust will block the sharing of that specific user\\'s data to partners and the Adjust SDK will continue to work as usual.\\nEnable or re-enable third-party sharing for specific users\\nCall the following method to instruct the Adjust SDK to communicate the user\\'s choice to share data or change data sharing, to the Adjust backend:\\nADJThirdPartySharing *adjustThirdPartySharing = [[ADJThirdPartySharing alloc] initWithIsEnabledNumberBool:@YES];\\n[Adjust trackThirdPartySharing:adjustThirdPartySharing];\\nUpon receiving this information, Adjust changes sharing the specific user\\'s data to partners. The Adjust SDK will continue to work as expected.\\nCall the following method to instruct the Adjust SDK to send the granular options to the Adjust backend:\\nADJThirdPartySharing *adjustThirdPartySharing = [[ADJThirdPartySharing alloc] initWithIsEnabledNumberBool:nil];\\n[adjustThirdPartySharing addGranularOption:@\"PartnerA\" key:@\"foo\" value:@\"bar\"];\\n[Adjust trackThirdPartySharing:adjustThirdPartySharing];\\nConsent measurement for specific users\\nTo enable or disable the Data Privacy settings in the Adjust Dashboard, including the consent expiry period and the user data retention period, you need to implement the below method.\\nCall the following method to instruct the Adjust SDK to communicate the Data Privacy settings, to the Adjust backend:\\n[Adjust trackMeasurementConsent:YES];\\nUpon receiving this information, Adjust changes sharing the specific user\\'s data to partners. The Adjust SDK will continue to work as expected.\\nSDK signature\\nThe Adjust SDK signature is enabled on a client-by-client basis. If you are interested in using this feature, please contact your account manager.\\nIf the SDK signature has already been enabled on your account and you have access to App Secrets in your Adjust Dashboard, please use the method below to integrate the SDK signature into your app.\\nAn App Secret is set by calling setAppSecret on your AdjustConfig instance:\\n[adjustConfig setAppSecret:secretId info1:info1 info2:info2 info3:info3 info4:info4];\\nBackground tracking\\nThe default behaviour of the Adjust SDK is to pause sending HTTP requests while the app is in the background. You can change this in your AdjustConfig instance:\\n[adjustConfig setSendInBackground:YES];\\nIf nothing is set, sending in background is disabled by default.\\nDevice IDs\\nThe Adjust SDK offers you possibility to obtain some of the device identifiers.\\niOS Advertising Identifier\\nCertain services (such as Google Analytics) require you to coordinate device and client IDs in order to prevent duplicate reporting.\\nTo obtain the device identifier IDFA, call the function idfa:\\nNSString *idfa = [Adjust idfa];\\nAdjust device identifier\\nFor each device with your app installed, adjust backend generates unique adjust device identifier (adid). In order to obtain this identifier, you can make a call to the following method on the Adjust instance:\\nNSString *adid = [Adjust adid];\\nNote: Information about the adid is available after the app\\'s installation has been tracked by the adjust backend. From that moment on, the Adjust SDK has information about the device adid and you can access it with this method. So, it is not possible to access the adid before the SDK has been initialised and the installation of your app has been tracked successfully.\\nUser attribution\\nThe attribution callback will be triggered as described in the attribution callback section, providing you with the information about any new attribution when ever it changes. In any other case, where you want to access information about your user\\'s current attribution, you can make a call to the following method of the Adjust instance:\\nADJAttribution *attribution = [Adjust attribution];\\nNote: Information about current attribution is available after app installation has been tracked by the adjust backend and attribution callback has been initially triggered. From that moment on, Adjust SDK has information about your user\\'s attribution and you can access it with this method. So, it is not possible to access user\\'s attribution value before the SDK has been initialised and attribution callback has been initially triggered.\\nPush token\\nPush tokens are used for Audience Builder and client callbacks, and they are required for uninstall and reinstall tracking.\\nTo send us the push notification token, add the following call to Adjust in the didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken of your app delegate:\\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)app didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {\\n    [Adjust setDeviceToken:deviceToken];\\n}\\nPre-installed trackers\\nIf you want to use the Adjust SDK to recognize users that found your app pre-installed on their device, follow these steps.\\nCreate a new tracker in your dashboard.\\nOpen your app delegate and add set the default tracker of your ADJConfig:\\nADJConfig *adjustConfig = [ADJConfig configWithAppToken:yourAppToken environment:environment];\\n[adjustConfig setDefaultTracker:@\"{TrackerToken}\"];\\n[Adjust appDidLaunch:adjustConfig];\\nReplace {TrackerToken} with the tracker token you created in step 2. Please note that the dashboard displays a tracker URL (including http://app.adjust.com/). In your source code, you should specify only the six-character token and not the entire URL.\\nBuild and run your app. You should see a line like the following in XCode:\\nDefault tracker: \\'abc123\\'\\nDeep linking\\nIf you are using the adjust tracker URL with an option to deep link into your app from the URL, there is the possibility to get info about the deep link URL and its content. Hitting the URL can happen when the user has your app already installed (standard deep linking scenario) or if they don\\'t have the app on their device (deferred deep linking scenario). Both of these scenarios are supported by the Adjust SDK and in both cases the deep link URL will be provided to you after you app has been started after hitting the tracker URL. In order to use this feature in your app, you need to set it up properly.\\nStandard deep linking scenario\\nIf your user already has the app installed and hits the tracker URL with deep link information in it, your application will be opened and the content of the deep link will be sent to your app so that you can parse it and decide what to do next. With introduction of iOS 9, Apple has changed the way how deep linking should be handled in the app. Depending on which scenario you want to use for your app (or if you want to use them both to support wide range of devices), you need to set up your app to handle one or both of the following scenarios.\\nDeep linking on iOS 8 and earlier\\nDeep linking on iOS 8 and earlier devices is being done with usage of a custom URL scheme setting. You need to pick a custom URL scheme name which your app will be in charge for opening. This scheme name will also be used in the adjust tracker URL as part of the deep_link parameter. In order to set this in your app, open your Info.plist file and add new URL types row to it. In there, as URL identifier write you app\\'s bundle ID and under URL schemes add scheme name(s) which you want your app to handle. In the example below, we have chosen that our app should handle the adjustExample scheme name.\\nAfter this has been set up, your app will be opened after you click the adjust tracker URL with deep_link parameter which contains the scheme name which you have chosen. After app is opened, openURL method of your AppDelegate class will be triggered and the place where the content of the deep_link parameter from the tracker URL will be delivered. If you want to access the content of the deep link, override this method.\\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app openURL:(NSURL *)url options:(NSDictionary *)options {\\n    // url object contains your deep link content\\n\\n    // Apply your logic to determine the return value of this method\\n    return YES;\\n    // or\\n    // return NO;\\n}\\nWith this setup, you have successfully set up deep linking handling for iOS devices with iOS 8 and earlier versions.\\nDeep linking on iOS 9 and later\\nIn order to set deep linking support for iOS 9 and later devices, you need to enable your app to handle Apple universal links. To find out more about universal links and how their setup looks like, you can check here.\\nAdjust is taking care of lots of things to do with universal links behind the scenes. But, in order to support universal links with the adjust, you need to perform small setup for universal links in the adjust dashboard. For more information on that should be done, please consult our official docs.\\nOnce you have successfully enabled the universal links feature in the dashboard, you need to do this in your app as well:\\nAfter enabling Associated Domains for your app in Apple Developer Portal, you need to do the same thing in your app\\'s Xcode project. After enabling Assciated Domains, add the universal link which was generated for you in the adjust dashboard in the Domains section by prefixing it with applinks: and make sure that you also remove the http(s) part of the universal link.\\nAfter this has been set up, your app will be opened after you click the adjust tracker universal link. After app is opened, continueUserActivity method of your AppDelegate class will be triggered and the place where the content of the universal link URL will be delivered. If you want to access the content of the deep link, override this method.\\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application continueUserActivity:(NSUserActivity *)userActivity\\n restorationHandler:(void (^)(NSArray *restorableObjects))restorationHandler {\\n    if ([[userActivity activityType] isEqualToString:NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb]) {\\n        NSURL *url = [userActivity webpageURL];\\n\\n        // url object contains your universal link content\\n    }\\n\\n    // Apply your logic to determine the return value of this method\\n    return YES;\\n    // or\\n    // return NO;\\n}\\nWith this setup, you have successfully set up deep linking handling for iOS devices with iOS 9 and later versions.\\nWe provide a helper function that allows you to convert a universal link to an old style deep link URL, in case you had some custom logic in your code which was always expecting deep link info to arrive in old style custom URL scheme format. You can call this method with universal link and the custom URL scheme name which you would like to see your deep link prefixed with and we will generate the custom URL scheme deep link for you:\\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application continueUserActivity:(NSUserActivity *)userActivity\\n restorationHandler:(void (^)(NSArray *restorableObjects))restorationHandler {\\n    if ([[userActivity activityType] isEqualToString:NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb]) {\\n        NSURL *url = [userActivity webpageURL];\\n\\n        NSURL *oldStyleDeeplink = [Adjust convertUniversalLink:url scheme:@\"adjustExample\"];\\n    }\\n\\n    // Apply your logic to determine the return value of this method\\n    return YES;\\n    // or\\n    // return NO;\\n}\\nDeferred deep linking scenario\\nYou can register a delegate callback to be notified before a deferred deep link is opened and decide if the Adjust SDK will try to open it. The same optional protocol AdjustDelegate used for the attribution callback and for event and session callbacks is used.\\nFollow the same steps and implement the following delegate callback function for deferred deep links:\\n- (BOOL)adjustDeeplinkResponse:(NSURL *)deeplink {\\n    // deeplink object contains information about deferred deep link content\\n\\n    // Apply your logic to determine whether the Adjust SDK should try to open the deep link\\n    return YES;\\n    // or\\n    // return NO;\\n}\\nThe callback function will be called after the SDK receives a deferred deep link from our server and before opening it. Within the callback function you have access to the deep link. The returned boolean value determines if the SDK will launch the deep link. You could, for example, not allow the SDK to open the deep link at the current moment, save it, and open it yourself later.\\nIf this callback is not implemented, the Adjust SDK will always try to open the deep link by default.\\nReattribution via deep links\\nAdjust enables you to run re-engagement campaigns with usage of deep links. For more information on how to do that, please check our official docs.\\nIf you are using this feature, in order for your user to be properly reattributed, you need to make one additional call to the Adjust SDK in your app.\\nOnce you have received deep link content information in your app, add a call to the appWillOpenUrl method. By making this call, the Adjust SDK will try to find if there is any new attribution info inside of the deep link and if any, it will be sent to the adjust backend. If your user should be reattributed due to a click on the adjust tracker URL with deep link content in it, you will see the attribution callback in your app being triggered with new attribution info for this user.\\nThe call to appWillOpenUrl should be done like this to support deep linking reattributions in all iOS versions:\\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)app openURL:(NSURL *)url options:(NSDictionary *)options {\\n    // url object contains your deep link content\\n    \\n    [Adjust appWillOpenUrl:url];\\n\\n    // Apply your logic to determine the return value of this method\\n    return YES;\\n    // or\\n    // return NO;\\n}\\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application continueUserActivity:(NSUserActivity *)userActivity\\n restorationHandler:(void (^)(NSArray *restorableObjects))restorationHandler {\\n    if ([[userActivity activityType] isEqualToString:NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb]) {\\n        NSURL url = [userActivity webpageURL];\\n\\n        [Adjust appWillOpenUrl:url];\\n    }\\n\\n    // Apply your logic to determine the return value of this method\\n    return YES;\\n    // or\\n    // return NO;\\n}\\nTroubleshooting\\nIssues with delayed SDK initialisation\\nAs described in the basic setup step, we strongly advise you to initialise the Adjust SDK in the didFinishLaunching or didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method of your app delegate. It is imperative to initialise the Adjust SDK in as soon as possible so that you can use all the features of the SDK.\\nDeciding not to initialise the Adjust SDK immediately can have all kinds of impacts on the tracking in your app: In order to perform any kind of tracking in your app, the Adjust SDK must be initialised.\\nIf you decide to perform any of these actions:\\nEvent tracking\\nReattribution via deep links\\nDisable tracking\\nOffline mode\\nbefore initialising the SDK, they won\\'t be performed.\\nIf you want any of these actions to be tracked with the Adjust SDK before its actual initialisation, you must build a custom actions queueing mechanism inside your app. You need to queue all the actions you want our SDK to perform and perform them once the SDK is initialised.\\nOffline mode state won\\'t be changed, tracking enabled/disabled state won\\'t be changed, deep link reattributions will not be possible to happen, any of tracked events will be dropped.\\nAnother thing which might be affected by delayed SDK initialisation is session tracking. The Adjust SDK can\\'t start to collect any session length info before it is actually initialised. This can affect your DAU numbers in the dashboard which might not be tracked properly.\\nAs an example, let\\'s assume this scenario: You are initialising the Adjust SDK when some specific view or view controller is loaded and let\\'s say that this is not the splash nor the first screen in your app, but user has to navigate to it from the home screen. If user downloads your app and opens it, the home screen will be displayed. At this moment, this user has made an install which should be tracked. However, the Adjust SDK doesn\\'t know anything about this, because the user needs to navigate to the screen mentioned previously where you decided to initialise the Adjust SDK. Further, if the user decides that he/she doesn\\'t like the app and uninstalls it right after seeing home screen, all the information mentioned above will never be tracked by our SDK, nor displayed in the dashboard.\\nEvent tracking\\nFor the events you want to track, queue them with some internal queueing mechanism and track them after SDK is initialised. Tracking events before initialising SDK will cause the events to be dropped and permanently lost, so make sure you are tracking them once SDK is initialised and enabled.\\nOffline mode and enable/disable tracking\\nOffline mode is not the feature which is persisted between SDK initialisations, so it is set to false by default. If you try to enable offline mode before initialising SDK, it will still be set to false when you eventually initialise the SDK.\\nEnabling/disabling tracking is the setting which is persisted between the SDK initialisations. If you try to toggle this value before initialising the SDK, toggle attempt will be ignored. Once initialised, SDK will be in the state (enabled or disabled) like before this toggle attempt.\\nReattribution via deep links\\nAs described above, when handling deep link reattributions, depending on deep linking mechanism you are using (old style vs. universal links), you will obtain NSURL object after which you need to make following call:\\n[Adjust appWillOpenUrl:url]\\nIf you make this call before the SDK has been initialised, information about the attribution information from the deep link URL will be permanetly lost. If you want the Adjust SDK to successfully reattribute your user, you would need to queue this NSURL object information and trigger appWillOpenUrl method once the SDK has been initialised.\\nSession tracking\\nSession tracking is something what the Adjust SDK performs automatically and is beyond reach of an app developer. For proper session tracking it is crucial to have the Adjust SDK initialised as advised in this README. Not doing so can have unpredicted influences on proper session tracking and DAU numbers in the dashboard.\\nFor example:\\nA user opens but then deletes your app before the SDK was even inialised, causing the install and session to have never been tracked, thus never reported in the dashboard.\\nIf a user downloads and opens your app before midnight, and the Adjust SDK gets initialised after midnight, all queued install and session data will be reported on wrong day.\\nIf a user didn\\'t use your app on some day but opens it shortly after midnight and the SDK gets initialised after midnight, causing DAU to be reported on another day from the day of the app opening.\\nFor all these reasons, please follow the instructions in this document and initialise the Adjust SDK in the didFinishLaunching or didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method of your app delegate.\\nI\\'m seeing \"Adjust requires ARC\" error\\nIf your build failed with the error Adjust requires ARC, it looks like your project is not using ARC. In that case we recommend transitioning your project so that it does use ARC. If you don\\'t want to use ARC, you have to enable ARC for all source files of adjust in the target\\'s Build Phases:\\nExpand the Compile Sources group, select all adjust files and change the Compiler Flags to -fobjc-arc (Select all and press the Return key to change all at once).\\nI\\'m seeing \"[UIDevice adjTrackingEnabled]: unrecognized selector sent to instance\" error\\nThis error can occur when you are adding the Adjust SDK framework to your app. The Adjust SDK contains categories among it\\'s source files and for this reason, if you have chosen this SDK integration approach, you need to add -ObjC flags to Other Linker Flags in your Xcode project settings. Adding this flag will fix this error.\\nI\\'m seeing the \"Session failed (Ignoring too frequent session.)\" error\\nThis error typically occurs when testing installs. Uninstalling and reinstalling the app is not enough to trigger a new install. The servers will determine that the SDK has lost its locally aggregated session data and ignore the erroneous message, given the information available on the servers about the device.\\nThis behaviour can be cumbersome during tests, but is necessary in order to have the sandbox behaviour match production as much as possible.\\nYou can reset the session data of the device in our servers. Check the error message in the logs:\\nSession failed (Ignoring too frequent session. Last session: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss, this session: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss, interval: XXs, min interval: 20m) (app_token: {yourAppToken}, adid: {adidValue})\\nWith the {yourAppToken} and either {adidValue} or {idfaValue} values filled in below, open one of the following links:\\nhttp://app.adjust.com/forget_device?app_token={yourAppToken}&adid={adidValue}\\nhttp://app.adjust.com/forget_device?app_token={yourAppToken}&idfa={idfaValue}\\nWhen the device is forgotten, the link just returns Forgot device. If the device was already forgotten or the values were incorrect, the link returns Device not found.\\nI\\'m not seeing \"Install tracked\" in the logs\\nIf you want to simulate the installation scenario of your app on your test device, it is not enough if you just re-run the app from the Xcode on your test device. Re-running the app from the Xcode doesn\\'t cause app data to be wiped out and all internal files that our SDK is keeping inside your app will still be there, so upon re-run, our SDK will see those files and think of your app was already installed (and that SDK was already launched in it) but just opened for another time rather than being opened for the first time.\\nIn order to run the app installation scenario, you need to do following:\\nUninstall app from your device (completely remove it)\\nForget your test device from the adjust backend like explained in the issue above\\nRun your app from the Xcode on the test device and you will see log message \"Install tracked\"\\nI\\'m seeing the \"Unattributable SDK click ignored\" message\\nYou may notice this message while testing your app in sandbox environment. It is related to some changes Apple introduced in iAd.framework version 3. With this, a user can be directed to your app from a click on iAd banner and this will cause our SDK to send an sdk_click package to the adjust backend informing it about the content of the clicked URL. For some reason, Apple decided that if the app was opened without clicking on iAd banner, they will artificially generate an iAd banner URL click with some random values. Our SDK won\\'t be able to distinguish if the iAd banner click was genuine or artificially generated and will send an sdk_click package regardless to the adjust backend. If you have your log level set to verbose, you will see this sdk_click package looking something like this:\\n[Adjust]d: Added package 1 (click)\\n[Adjust]v: Path:      /sdk_click\\n[Adjust]v: ClientSdk: ios4.10.1\\n[Adjust]v: Parameters:\\n[Adjust]v:      app_token              {YourAppToken}\\n[Adjust]v:      created_at             2016-04-15T14:25:51.676Z+0200\\n[Adjust]v:      details                {\"Version3.1\":{\"iad-lineitem-id\":\"1234567890\",\"iad-org-name\":\"OrgName\",\"iad-creative-name\":\"CreativeName\",\"iad-click-date\":\"2016-04-15T12:25:51Z\",\"iad-campaign-id\":\"1234567890\",\"iad-attribution\":\"true\",\"iad-lineitem-name\":\"LineName\",\"iad-creative-id\":\"1234567890\",\"iad-campaign-name\":\"CampaignName\",\"iad-conversion-date\":\"2016-04-15T12:25:51Z\"}}\\n[Adjust]v:      environment            sandbox\\n[Adjust]v:      idfa                   XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX\\n[Adjust]v:      idfv                   YYYYYYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYY-YYYYYYYYYYYY\\n[Adjust]v:      needs_response_details 1\\n[Adjust]v:      source                 iad3\\nIf for some reason this sdk_click would be accepted, it would mean that a user who has opened your app by clicking on some other campaign URL or even as an organic user, will get attributed to this unexisting iAd source. This is the reason why our backend ignores it and informs you with this message:\\n[Adjust]v: Response: {\"message\":\"Unattributable SDK click ignored.\"}\\n[Adjust]i: Unattributable SDK click ignored.\\nSo, this message doesn\\'t indicate any issue with your SDK integration but it\\'s simply informing you that our backend has ignored this artificially created sdk_click which could have lead to your user being wrongly attributed/reattributed.\\nI\\'m seeing incorrect revenue data in the adjust dashboard\\nThe Adjust SDK tracks what you tell it to track. If you are attaching revenue to your event, the number you write as an amount is the only amount which will reach the adjust backend and be displayed in the dashboard. Our SDK does not manipulate your amount value, nor does our backend. So, if you see wrong amount being tracked, it\\'s because our SDK was told to track that amount.\\nUsually, a user\\'s code for tracking revenue event looks something like this:\\n// ...\\n\\n- (double)someLogicForGettingRevenueAmount {\\n    // This method somehow handles how user determines\\n    // what\\'s the revenue value which should be tracked.\\n\\n    // It is maybe making some calculations to determine it.\\n\\n    // Or maybe extracting the info from In-App purchase which\\n    // was successfully finished.\\n\\n    // Or maybe returns some predefined double value.\\n\\n    double amount; // double amount = some double value\\n\\n    return amount;\\n}\\n\\n// ...\\n\\n- (void)someRandomMethodInTheApp {\\n    double amount = [self someLogicForGettingRevenueAmount];\\n\\n    ADJEvent *event = [ADJEvent eventWithEventToken:@\"abc123\"];\\n    [event setRevenue:amount currency:@\"EUR\"];\\n    [Adjust trackEvent:event];\\n}\\nIf you are seing any value in the dashboard other than what you expected to be tracked, please, check your logic for determining amount value.\\nLicense\\nThe Adjust SDK is licensed under the MIT License.\\nCopyright (c) 2012-2021 Adjust GmbH, http://www.adjust.com\\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

       " \"flow-typed is a repository of third-party library interface definitions for use with Flow.\\nYou can grab definitions directly from this GitHub repo, or you can use the CLI (currently in beta) to install a libdef for a given library:\\n$ yarn global add flow-typed\\n\\n$ cd /path/to/my/project\\n$ yarn install\\n$ flow-typed install rxjs@5.0.x\\n'rxjs_v5.0.x.js' installed at /path/to/my/project/flow-typed/npm/rxjs_v5.0.x.js\\nHuh?\\nWhen you start a project with Flow, you likely want to use some third-party libraries that were not written with Flow. By default, Flow will just ignore these libraries leaving them untyped. As a result, Flow can't give errors if you accidentally mis-use the library (nor will it be able to auto-complete the library).\\nTo address this, Flow supports library definitions which allow you to describe the interface of a module or library separate from the implementation of that module/library.\\nThe flow-typed repo is a collection of high-quality library definitions, tests to ensure that definitions remain high quality, and tooling to make it as easy as possible to import them into your project.\\nAll you have to do when you add one or more new dependencies to your project is run flow-typed install. This will search the libdef repo and download all the libdefs that are relevant for your project and install them for you. After that, simply check them in and be on your way!\\nGetting Started\\nCheck out Importing And Using Type Definitions in the wiki. It will walk you through using typedefs installed through flow-typed, as well as writing and including your own.\\nFAQs\\nBefore opening an issue, take a look at the FAQs. Chances are your question has already been answered! If not, don't hesitate to open an issue.\\nHow Do I Contribute Library Definitions?\\nJust send a pull request! The wiki on Contributing Library Definitions details the format of new contributions. Contributions should follow the best practices outline on CONTRIBUTING.md.\\nContributing to the CLI\\nBugfixes and improvements to the core CLI are welcome. If you'd like to contribute a new feature, consider opening an issue first to discuss it.\\nflow-typed CLI\\nThe flow-typed npm package provides a CLI that includes several commands for working with this repository. The full list of commands is available at CLI Commands & Flags.\\nflow-typed install [package-specification] [--ignoreDeps deps]\\nInstalls libdefs from looking at your package.json.\\nIf package-specification was specified, only that one libdef will be installed. If the --ignoreDeps flag was specified, the libdefs for the specified deps will be ignored. i.e: --ignoreDeps dev bundled peer.\\nflow-typed install foo@1.2.3\\nflow-typed validate-defs\\nVerifies that all files under the /definitions/ directory are structured and named properly. It does not run tests, it only asserts that file and directory names match the expected conventions.\\nThis command is run during CI.\\nflow-typed run-tests [optional-pattern]\\nFor each libdef, find each test and run it with all compatible versions of Flow. If any errors arise that are not // $FlowExpectedError, the test has failed.\\nNote that this command assumes that the /definitions/ directory is correctly structured. It should be run after running flow-typed validate-defs.\\nflow-typed update-cache [--debug]\\nBy default flow-typed retrieves all available libdefs from its related upstream repository. To make this process more efficient, those libdefs are cached once on your local filesystem. Usually, the cache will automatically be updated after a short grace period during a libdef installation, but sometimes it is useful to do this update manually. Use this command if you want to download the most recent definitions into the cache for yourself.\\nflow-typed create-stub package-specification [--typescript]\\nCreates any-typed libdef that you can fill in.\\nIf the --typescript flag was set to true, TypeScript definition would be converted to flow-typed libdef format if possible. Please report any issues that you have encountered to flowgen repository.\\nflowgen supports most of the TypeScript syntax, however, in some cases manual changes may be needed before use. You can check out supported syntax constructs in flowgen's “The state of converter” section.\\nAfter you have edited these files, consider contributing them back to flow-typed.\\nActive Maintenance Team\\n@AndrewSouthpaw @GAntoine @pascalduez @villesau\",\n",

The Firebase Xcode project contains dummy plist files without real values, but can be replaced with real plist files. To get your own GoogleService-Info.plist files:\\nGo to the Firebase Console\\nCreate a new Firebase project, if you don\\'t already have one\\nFor each sample app you want to test, create a new Firebase app with the sample app\\'s bundle identifier (e.g. com.google.Database-Example)\\nDownload the resulting GoogleService-Info.plist and add it to the Xcode project.\\nSpecific Component Instructions\\nSee the sections below for any special instructions for those components.\\nFirebase Auth\\nIf you\\'re doing specific Firebase Auth development, see the Auth Sample README for instructions about building and running the FirebaseAuth pod along with various samples and tests.\\nFirebase Database\\nThe Firebase Database Integration tests can be run against a locally running Database Emulator or against a production instance.\\nTo run against a local emulator instance, invoke ./scripts/run_database_emulator.sh start before running the integration test.\\nTo run against a production instance, provide a valid GoogleServices-Info.plist and copy it to FirebaseDatabase/Tests/Resources/GoogleService-Info.plist. Your Security Rule must be set to public while your tests are running.\\nFirebase Performance Monitoring\\nIf you\\'re doing specific Firebase Performance Monitoring development, see the Performance README for instructions about building the SDK and the Performance TestApp README for instructions about integrating Performance with the dev test App.\\nFirebase Storage\\nTo run the Storage Integration tests, follow the instructions in FIRStorageIntegrationTests.m.\\nPush Notifications\\nPush notifications can only be delivered to specially provisioned App IDs in the developer portal. In order to actually test receiving push notifications, you will need to:\\nChange the bundle identifier of the sample app to something you own in your Apple Developer account, and enable that App ID for push notifications.\\nYou\\'ll also need to upload your APNs Provider Authentication Key or certificate to the Firebase Console at Project Settings > Cloud Messaging > [Your Firebase App].\\nEnsure your iOS device is added to your Apple Developer portal as a test device.\\niOS Simulator\\nThe iOS Simulator cannot register for remote notifications, and will not receive push notifications. In order to receive push notifications, you\\'ll have to follow the steps above and run the app on a physical device.\\nCommunity Supported Efforts\\nWe\\'ve seen an amazing amount of interest and contributions to improve the Firebase SDKs, and we are very grateful! We\\'d like to empower as many developers as we can to be able to use Firebase and participate in the Firebase community.\\ntvOS, macOS, watchOS and Catalyst\\nThanks to contributions from the community, many of Firebase SDKs now compile, run unit tests, and work on tvOS, macOS, watchOS and Catalyst.\\nFor tvOS, see the Sample. For watchOS, currently only Messaging, Storage and Crashlytics (and their dependencies) have limited support. See the Independent Watch App Sample.\\nKeep in mind that macOS, tvOS, watchOS and Catalyst are not officially supported by Firebase, and this repository is actively developed primarily for iOS. While we can catch basic unit test issues with GitHub Actions, there may be some changes where the SDK no longer works as expected on macOS, tvOS or watchOS. If you encounter this, please file an issue.\\nDuring app setup in the console, you may get to a step that mentions something like \"Checking if the app has communicated with our servers\". This relies on Analytics and will not work on macOS/tvOS/watchOS/Catalyst. It\\'s safe to ignore the message and continue, the rest of the SDKs will work as expected.\\nTo install, add a subset of the following to the Podfile:\\npod \\'Firebase/ABTesting\\'\\npod \\'Firebase/Auth\\'          # Limited watchOS support\\npod \\'Firebase/Crashlytics\\'\\npod \\'Firebase/Database\\'      # No watchOS support yet\\npod \\'Firebase/Firestore\\'     # No watchOS support yet\\npod \\'Firebase/Functions\\'     # No watchOS support yet\\npod \\'Firebase/Messaging\\'\\npod \\'Firebase/Performance\\'   # No macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and Catalyst support yet\\npod \\'Firebase/RemoteConfig\\'\\npod \\'Firebase/Storage\\'\\nAdditional Catalyst Notes\\nFirebaseAuth and FirebaseMessaging require adding Keychain Sharing Capability to Build Settings.\\nFirebaseFirestore requires signing the gRPC Resource target.\\nAdditional Crashlytics Notes\\nwatchOS has limited support. Due to watchOS restrictions, mach exceptions and signal crashes are not recorded. (Crashes in SwiftUI are generated as mach exceptions, so will not be recorded)\\nRoadmap\\nSee Roadmap for more about the Firebase iOS SDK Open Source plans and directions.\\nContributing\\nSee Contributing for more information on contributing to the Firebase iOS SDK.\\nLicense\\nThe contents of this repository is licensed under the Apache License, version 2.0.\\nYour use of Firebase is governed by the Terms of Service for Firebase Services.',\n",

Use zoom in/out function (W/S keys) and camera left, right, up, down translation (U/H/J/K keys). When you have aligned, hit \\'X\\' to use this frame as reference to drive the rest of the animation\\nUse the image overlay function (Z/C keys) or the face detection overlay function (O key) to match your and avatar\\'s face expressions as close as possible\\nAlternatively, you can hit \\'F\\' for the software to attempt to find a better reference frame itself. This will slow down the framerate, but while this is happening, you can keep moving your head around: the preview window will flash green when it finds your facial pose is a closer match to the avatar than the one it is currently using. You will see two numbers displayed as well: the first number is how closely you are currently aligned to the avatar, and the second number is how closely the reference frame is aligned.\\nYou want to get the first number as small as possible - around 10 is usually a good alignment. When you are done, press \\'F\\' again to exit reference frame search mode.\\nYou don\\'t need to be exact, and some other configurations can yield better results still, but it\\'s usually a good starting point.\\nConfigure video meeting app\\nAvatarify supports any video-conferencing app where video input source can be changed (Zoom, Skype, Hangouts, Slack, ...). Here are a few examples how to configure particular app to use Avatarify.\\nSkype\\nGo to Settings -> Audio & Video, choose avatarify (Linux), CamTwist (Mac) or OBS-Camera (Windows) camera.\\nZoom\\nGo to Settings -> Video and choose avatarify (Linux), CamTwist (Mac) or OBS-Camera (Windows) from Camera drop-down menu.\\nTeams\\nGo to your profile picture -> Settings -> Devices and choose avatarify (Linux), CamTwist (Mac) or OBS-Camera (Windows) from Camera drop-down menu.\\nSlack\\nMake a call, allow browser using cameras, click on Settings icon, choose avatarify (Linux), CamTwist (Mac) or OBS-Camera (Windows) in Video settings drop-down menu.\\nUninstall\\nTo remove Avatarify and its related programs follow the instructions in the Wiki.\\nContribution\\nOur goal is to democratize photorealistic avatars for video-conferencing. To make the technology even more accessible, we have to tackle the following problems:\\nAdd support for more platforms (Linux and Mac are already supported).\\nRemote GPU support. This is a work in progress.\\nPorting to non-CUDA GPUs (Intel integrated GPUs, AMD GPUs, etc) and optimization. The goal is to run Avatarify real-time (at least 10FPS) on modern laptops.\\nPlease make pull requests if you have any improvements or bug-fixes.\\nFAQ\\nQ: Do I need any knowledge of programming to run Avatarify?\\nA: Not really, but you need some beginner-level knowledge of the command line. For Windows we recorded a video tutorial, so it’ll be easy to install.\\nQ: Why does it work so slow on my Macbook?\\nA: The model used in Avatarify requires a CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPU to perform heavy computations. Macbooks don’t have such GPUs, and for processing use CPU, which has much less computing power to run Avatarify smoothly.\\nQ: I don’t have a NVIDIA GPU, can I run it?\\nA: You still can run it without a NVIDIA GPU, but with drastically reduced performance (<1fps).\\nQ: I have an ATI GPU (e.g. Radeon). Why does it work so slow?\\nA: To run the neural network Avatarify uses PyTorch library, which is optimized for CUDA. If PyTorch can’t find a CUDA-enabled GPU in your system it will fallback to CPU. The performance on the CPU will be much worse.\\nQ: How to add a new avatar?\\nA: It’s easy. All you need is to find a picture of your avatar and put it in the avatars folder. More.\\nQ: My avatar looks distorted.\\nA: You need to calibrate your face position. Please follow the tips or watch the video tutorial.\\nQ: Can I use a cloud GPU?\\nA: This is work in progress. See the relevant discussion.\\nQ: Avatarify crashed, what to do?\\nA: First, try to find your error in the troubleshooting section. If it is not there, try to find it in the issues. If you couldn’t find your issue there, please open a new one using the issue template.\\nQ: Can I use Avatarify for commercial purposes?\\nA: No. Avatarify and First Order Motion Model are licensed under Creative Commons Non-Commercial license, which prohibits commercial use.\\nQ: What video conferencing apps does Avatarify support?\\nA: Avatarify creates a virtual camera which can be plugged into any app where video input source can be changed (Zoom, Skype, Hangouts, Slack, ...).\\nQ: Where can I discuss Avatarify-related topics with the community?\\nA: We have Slack. Please join:\\nTroubleshooting\\nPlease follow the Wiki page.',\n",

The SDK core packages are all available under the aws package at the root of the SDK. Each client for a supported AWS service is available within its own package under the service folder at the root of the SDK.\\naws - SDK core, provides common shared types such as Config, Logger, and utilities to make working with API parameters easier.\\nawserr - Provides the error interface that the SDK will use for all errors that occur in the SDK\\'s processing. This includes service API response errors as well. The Error type is made up of a code and message. Cast the SDK\\'s returned error type to awserr.Error and call the Code method to compare returned error to specific error codes. See the package\\'s documentation for additional values that can be extracted such as RequestID.\\ncredentials - Provides the types and built in credentials providers the SDK will use to retrieve AWS credentials to make API requests with. Nested under this folder are also additional credentials providers such as stscreds for assuming IAM roles, and ec2rolecreds for EC2 Instance roles.\\nendpoints - Provides the AWS Regions and Endpoints metadata for the SDK. Use this to lookup AWS service endpoint information such as which services are in a region, and what regions a service is in. Constants are also provided for all region identifiers, e.g UsWest2RegionID for \"us-west-2\".\\nsession - Provides initial default configuration, and load configuration from external sources such as environment and shared credentials file.\\nrequest - Provides the API request sending, and retry logic for the SDK. This package also includes utilities for defining your own request retryer, and configuring how the SDK processes the request.\\nservice - Clients for AWS services. All services supported by the SDK are available under this folder.\\nHow to Use the SDK\\'s AWS Service Clients\\nThe SDK includes the Go types and utilities you can use to make requests to AWS service APIs. Within the service folder at the root of the SDK you\\'ll find a package for each AWS service the SDK supports. All service clients follow common pattern of creation and usage.\\nWhen creating a client for an AWS service you\\'ll first need to have a Session value constructed. The Session provides shared configuration that can be shared between your service clients. When service clients are created you can pass in additional configuration via the aws.Config type to override configuration provided by in the Session to create service client instances with custom configuration.\\nOnce the service\\'s client is created you can use it to make API requests the AWS service. These clients are safe to use concurrently.\\nConfiguring the SDK\\nIn the AWS SDK for Go, you can configure settings for service clients, such as the log level and maximum number of retries. Most settings are optional; however, for each service client, you must specify a region and your credentials. The SDK uses these values to send requests to the correct AWS region and sign requests with the correct credentials. You can specify these values as part of a session or as environment variables.\\nSee the SDK\\'s configuration guide for more information.\\nSee the session package documentation for more information on how to use Session with the SDK.\\nSee the Config type in the aws package for more information on configuration options.\\nConfiguring Credentials\\nWhen using the SDK you\\'ll generally need your AWS credentials to authenticate with AWS services. The SDK supports multiple methods of supporting these credentials. By default the SDK will source credentials automatically from its default credential chain. See the session package for more information on this chain, and how to configure it. The common items in the credential chain are the following:\\nEnvironment Credentials - Set of environment variables that are useful when sub processes are created for specific roles.\\nShared Credentials file (~/.aws/credentials) - This file stores your credentials based on a profile name and is useful for local development.\\nEC2 Instance Role Credentials - Use EC2 Instance Role to assign credentials to application running on an EC2 instance. This removes the need to manage credential files in production.\\nCredentials can be configured in code as well by setting the Config\\'s Credentials value to a custom provider or using one of the providers included with the SDK to bypass the default credential chain and use a custom one. This is helpful when you want to instruct the SDK to only use a specific set of credentials or providers.\\nThis example creates a credential provider for assuming an IAM role, \"myRoleARN\" and configures the S3 service client to use that role for API requests.\\n  // Initial credentials loaded from SDK\\'s default credential chain. Such as\\n  // the environment, shared credentials (~/.aws/credentials), or EC2 Instance\\n  // Role. These credentials will be used to to make the STS Assume Role API.\\n  sess := session.Must(session.NewSession())\\n\\n  // Create the credentials from AssumeRoleProvider to assume the role\\n  // referenced by the \"myRoleARN\" ARN.\\n  creds := stscreds.NewCredentials(sess, \"myRoleArn\")\\n\\n  // Create service client value configured for credentials\\n  // from assumed role.\\n  svc := s3.New(sess, &aws.Config{Credentials: creds})\\nSee the credentials package documentation for more information on credential providers included with the SDK, and how to customize the SDK\\'s usage of credentials.\\nThe SDK has support for the shared configuration file (~/.aws/config). This support can be enabled by setting the environment variable, \"AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG=1\", or enabling the feature in code when creating a Session via the Option\\'s SharedConfigState parameter.\\n  sess := session.Must(session.NewSessionWithOptions(session.Options{\\n      SharedConfigState: session.SharedConfigEnable,\\n  }))\\nConfiguring AWS Region\\nIn addition to the credentials you\\'ll need to specify the region the SDK will use to make AWS API requests to. In the SDK you can specify the region either with an environment variable, or directly in code when a Session or service client is created. The last value specified in code wins if the region is specified multiple ways.\\nTo set the region via the environment variable set the \"AWS_REGION\" to the region you want to the SDK to use. Using this method to set the region will allow you to run your application in multiple regions without needing additional code in the application to select the region.\\nAWS_REGION=us-west-2\\nThe endpoints package includes constants for all regions the SDK knows. The values are all suffixed with RegionID. These values are helpful, because they reduce the need to type the region string manually.\\nTo set the region on a Session use the aws package\\'s Config struct parameter Region to the AWS region you want the service clients created from the session to use. This is helpful when you want to create multiple service clients, and all of the clients make API requests to the same region.\\n  sess := session.Must(session.NewSession(&aws.Config{\\n      Region: aws.String(endpoints.UsWest2RegionID),\\n  }))\\nSee the endpoints package for the AWS Regions and Endpoints metadata.\\nIn addition to setting the region when creating a Session you can also set the region on a per service client bases. This overrides the region of a Session. This is helpful when you want to create service clients in specific regions different from the Session\\'s region.\\n  svc := s3.New(sess, &aws.Config{\\n      Region: aws.String(endpoints.UsWest2RegionID),\\n  })\\nSee the Config type in the aws package for more information and additional options such as setting the Endpoint, and other service client configuration options.\\nMaking API Requests\\nOnce the client is created you can make an API request to the service. Each API method takes a input parameter, and returns the service response and an error. The SDK provides methods for making the API call in multiple ways.\\nIn this list we\\'ll use the S3 ListObjects API as an example for the different ways of making API requests.\\nListObjects - Base API operation that will make the API request to the service.\\nListObjectsRequest - API methods suffixed with Request will construct the API request, but not send it. This is also helpful when you want to get a presigned URL for a request, and share the presigned URL instead of your application making the request directly.\\nListObjectsPages - Same as the base API operation, but uses a callback to automatically handle pagination of the API\\'s response.\\nListObjectsWithContext - Same as base API operation, but adds support for the Context pattern. This is helpful for controlling the canceling of in flight requests. See the Go standard library context package for more information. This method also takes request package\\'s Option functional options as the variadic argument for modifying how the request will be made, or extracting information from the raw HTTP response.\\nListObjectsPagesWithContext - same as ListObjectsPages, but adds support for the Context pattern. Similar to ListObjectsWithContext this method also takes the request package\\'s Option function option types as the variadic argument.\\nIn addition to the API operations the SDK also includes several higher level methods that abstract checking for and waiting for an AWS resource to be in a desired state. In this list we\\'ll use WaitUntilBucketExists to demonstrate the different forms of waiters.\\nWaitUntilBucketExists. - Method to make API request to query an AWS service for a resource\\'s state. Will return successfully when that state is accomplished.\\nWaitUntilBucketExistsWithContext - Same as WaitUntilBucketExists, but adds support for the Context pattern. In addition these methods take request package\\'s WaiterOptions to configure the waiter, and how underlying request will be made by the SDK.\\nThe API method will document which error codes the service might return for the operation. These errors will also be available as const strings prefixed with \"ErrCode\" in the service client\\'s package. If there are no errors listed in the API\\'s SDK documentation you\\'ll need to consult the AWS service\\'s API documentation for the errors that could be returned.\\n  ctx := context.Background()\\n\\n  result, err := svc.GetObjectWithContext(ctx, &s3.GetObjectInput{\\n      Bucket: aws.String(\"my-bucket\"),\\n      Key: aws.String(\"my-key\"),\\n  })\\n  if err != nil {\\n      // Cast err to awserr.Error to handle specific error codes.\\n      aerr, ok := err.(awserr.Error)\\n      if ok && aerr.Code() == s3.ErrCodeNoSuchKey {\\n          // Specific error code handling\\n      }\\n      return err\\n  }\\n\\n  // Make sure to close the body when done with it for S3 GetObject APIs or\\n  // will leak connections.\\n  defer result.Body.Close()\\n\\n  fmt.Println(\"Object Size:\", aws.Int64Value(result.ContentLength))\\nAPI Request Pagination and Resource Waiters\\nPagination helper methods are suffixed with \"Pages\", and provide the functionality needed to round trip API page requests. Pagination methods take a callback function that will be called for each page of the API\\'s response.\\n   objects := []string{}\\n   err := svc.ListObjectsPagesWithContext(ctx, &s3.ListObjectsInput{\\n       Bucket: aws.String(myBucket),\\n   }, func(p *s3.ListObjectsOutput, lastPage bool) bool {\\n       for _, o := range p.Contents {\\n           objects = append(objects, aws.StringValue(o.Key))\\n       }\\n       return true // continue paging\\n   })\\n   if err != nil {\\n       panic(fmt.Sprintf(\"failed to list objects for bucket, %s, %v\", myBucket, err))\\n   }\\n\\n   fmt.Println(\"Objects in bucket:\", objects)\\nWaiter helper methods provide the functionality to wait for an AWS resource state. These methods abstract the logic needed to check the state of an AWS resource, and wait until that resource is in a desired state. The waiter will block until the resource is in the state that is desired, an error occurs, or the waiter times out. If a resource times out the error code returned will be request.WaiterResourceNotReadyErrorCode.\\n  err := svc.WaitUntilBucketExistsWithContext(ctx, &s3.HeadBucketInput{\\n      Bucket: aws.String(myBucket),\\n  })\\n  if err != nil {\\n      aerr, ok := err.(awserr.Error)\\n      if ok && aerr.Code() == request.WaiterResourceNotReadyErrorCode {\\n          fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, \"timed out while waiting for bucket to exist\")\\n      }\\n      panic(fmt.Errorf(\"failed to wait for bucket to exist, %v\", err))\\n  }\\n  fmt.Println(\"Bucket\", myBucket, \"exists\")\\nGetting Help\\nPlease use these community resources for getting help. We use the GitHub issues for tracking bugs and feature requests.\\nAsk a question on StackOverflow and tag it with the aws-sdk-go tag.\\nCome join the AWS SDK for Go community chat on gitter.\\nOpen a support ticket with AWS Support.\\nIf you think you may have found a bug, please open an issue.\\nThis SDK implements AWS service APIs.

Failure during the running of any of these tools results in a failed build. Generally, code must be adjusted to satisfy these tools, though there are exceptions.\\ngo vet checks for Go code that should be considered incorrect.\\ngo fmt checks that Go code is correctly formatted.\\ngo mod tidy ensures that the source code and go.mod agree.\\nstaticcheck checks for things like: unused code, code that can be simplified, code that is incorrect and code that will have performance issues.\\nstaticcheck\\nIf your PR fails staticcheck it is easy to dig into why it failed, and also to fix the problem. First, take a look at the error message in Circle under the staticcheck build section, e.g.,\\ntsdb/tsm1/encoding.gen.go:1445:24: func BooleanValues.assertOrdered is unused (U1000)\\ntsdb/tsm1/encoding.go:172:7: receiver name should not be an underscore, omit the name if it is unused (ST1006)\\nNext, go and take a look here for some clarification on the error code that you have received, e.g., U1000. The docs will tell you what\\'s wrong, and often what you need to do to fix the issue.\\nGenerated Code\\nSometimes generated code will contain unused code or occasionally that will fail a different check. staticcheck allows for entire files to be ignored, though it\\'s not ideal. A linter directive, in the form of a comment, must be placed within the generated file. This is problematic because it will be erased if the file is re-generated. Until a better solution comes about, below is the list of generated files that need an ignores comment. If you re-generate a file and find that staticcheck has failed, please see this list below for what you need to put back:\\nFile Comment\\nquery/promql/promql.go //lint:file-ignore SA6001 Ignore all unused code, it\\'s generated\\nEnd-to-End Tests\\nCI also runs end-to-end tests. These test the integration between the influx server the ui. You can run them locally in two steps:\\nStart the server in \"testing mode\" by running make run-e2e.\\nRun the tests with make e2e.',\n",
       " 'Sql driver mock for Golang\\nsqlmock is a mock library implementing sql/driver. Which has one and only purpose - to simulate any sql driver behavior in tests, without needing a real database connection. It helps to maintain correct TDD workflow.\\nthis library is now complete and stable. (you may not find new changes for this reason)\\nsupports concurrency and multiple connections.\\nsupports go1.8 Context related feature mocking and Named sql parameters.\\ndoes not require any modifications to your source code.\\nthe driver allows to mock any sql driver method behavior.\\nhas strict by default expectation order matching.\\nhas no third party dependencies.\\nNOTE: in v1.2.0 sqlmock.Rows has changed to struct from interface, if you were using any type references to that interface, you will need to switch it to a pointer struct type. Also, sqlmock.Rows were used to implement driver.Rows interface, which was not required or useful for mocking and was removed. Hope it will not cause issues.\\nLooking for maintainers\\nI do not have much spare time for this library and willing to transfer the repository ownership to person or an organization motivated to maintain it. Open up a conversation if you are interested. See #230.\\nInstall\\ngo get github.com/DATA-DOG/go-sqlmock\\nDocumentation and Examples\\nVisit godoc for general examples and public api reference. See .travis.yml for supported go versions. Different use case, is to functionally test with a real database - go-txdb all database related actions are isolated within a single transaction so the database can remain in the same state.\\nSee implementation examples:\\nblog API server\\nthe same orders example\\nSomething you may want to test, assuming you use the go-mysql-driver\\npackage main\\n\\nimport (\\n \"database/sql\"\\n\\n _ \"github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql\"\\n)\\n\\nfunc recordStats(db *sql.DB, userID, productID int64) (err error) {\\n tx, err := db.Begin()\\n if err != nil {\\n  return\\n }\\n\\n defer func() {\\n  switch err {\\n  case nil:\\n   err = tx.Commit()\\n  default:\\n   tx.Rollback()\\n  }\\n }()\\n\\n if _, err = tx.Exec(\"UPDATE products SET views = views + 1\"); err != nil {\\n  return\\n }\\n if _, err = tx.Exec(\"INSERT INTO product_viewers (user_id, product_id) VALUES (?, ?)\", userID, productID); err != nil {\\n  return\\n }\\n return\\n}\\n\\nfunc main() {\\n // @NOTE: the real connection is not required for tests\\n db, err := sql.Open(\"mysql\", \"root@/blog\")\\n if err != nil {\\n  panic(err)\\n }\\n defer db.Close()\\n\\n if err = recordStats(db, 1 /*some user id*/, 5 /*some product id*/); err != nil {\\n  panic(err)\\n }\\n}\\nTests with sqlmock\\npackage main\\n\\nimport (\\n \"fmt\"\\n \"testing\"\\n\\n \"github.com/DATA-DOG/go-sqlmock\"\\n)\\n\\n// a successful case\\nfunc TestShouldUpdateStats(t *testing.T) {\\n db, mock, err := sqlmock.New()\\n if err != nil {\\n  t.Fatalf(\"an error \\'%s\\' was not expected when opening a stub database connection\", err)\\n }\\n defer db.Close()\\n\\n mock.ExpectBegin()\\n mock.ExpectExec(\"UPDATE products\").WillReturnResult(sqlmock.NewResult(1, 1))\\n mock.ExpectExec(\"INSERT INTO product_viewers\").WithArgs(2, 3).WillReturnResult(sqlmock.NewResult(1, 1))\\n mock.ExpectCommit()\\n\\n // now we execute our method\\n if err = recordStats(db, 2, 3); err != nil {\\n  t.Errorf(\"error was not expected while updating stats: %s\", err)\\n }\\n\\n // we make sure that all expectations were met\\n if err := mock.ExpectationsWereMet(); err != nil {\\n  t.Errorf(\"there were unfulfilled expectations: %s\", err)\\n }\\n}\\n\\n// a failing test case\\nfunc TestShouldRollbackStatUpdatesOnFailure(t *testing.T) {\\n db, mock, err := sqlmock.New()\\n if err != nil {\\n  t.Fatalf(\"an error \\'%s\\' was not expected when opening a stub database connection\", err)\\n }\\n defer db.Close()\\n\\n mock.ExpectBegin()\\n mock.ExpectExec(\"UPDATE products\").WillReturnResult(sqlmock.NewResult(1, 1))\\n mock.ExpectExec(\"INSERT INTO product_viewers\").\\n  WithArgs(2, 3).\\n  WillReturnError(fmt.Errorf(\"some error\"))\\n mock.ExpectRollback()\\n\\n // now we execute our method\\n if err = recordStats(db, 2, 3); err == nil {\\n  t.Errorf(\"was expecting an error, but there was none\")\\n }\\n\\n // we make sure that all expectations were met\\n if err := mock.ExpectationsWereMet(); err != nil {\\n  t.Errorf(\"there were unfulfilled expectations: %s\", err)\\n }\\n}\\nCustomize SQL query matching\\nThere were plenty of requests from users regarding SQL query string validation or different matching option. We have now implemented the QueryMatcher interface, which can be passed through an option when calling sqlmock.New or sqlmock.NewWithDSN.\\nThis now allows to include some library, which would allow for example to parse and validate mysql SQL AST. And create a custom QueryMatcher in order to validate SQL in sophisticated ways.\\nBy default, sqlmock is preserving backward compatibility and default query matcher is sqlmock.QueryMatcherRegexp which uses expected SQL string as a regular expression to match incoming query string. There is an equality matcher: QueryMatcherEqual which will do a full case sensitive match.\\nIn order to customize the QueryMatcher, use the following:\\n db, mock, err := sqlmock.New(sqlmock.QueryMatcherOption(sqlmock.QueryMatcherEqual))\\nThe query matcher can be fully customized based on user needs. sqlmock will not provide a standard sql parsing matchers, since various drivers may not follow the same SQL standard.\\nMatching arguments like time.Time\\nThere may be arguments which are of struct type and cannot be compared easily by value like time.Time. In this case sqlmock provides an Argument interface which can be used in more sophisticated matching. Here is a simple example of time argument matching:\\ntype AnyTime struct{}\\n\\n// Match satisfies sqlmock.Argument interface\\nfunc (a AnyTime) Match(v driver.Value) bool {\\n _, ok := v.(time.Time)\\n return ok\\n}\\n\\nfunc TestAnyTimeArgument(t *testing.T) {\\n t.Parallel()\\n db, mock, err := New()\\n if err != nil {\\n  t.Errorf(\"an error \\'%s\\' was not expected when opening a stub database connection\", err)\\n }\\n defer db.Close()\\n\\n mock.ExpectExec(\"INSERT INTO users\").\\n  WithArgs(\"john\", AnyTime{}).\\n  WillReturnResult(NewResult(1, 1))\\n\\n _, err = db.Exec(\"INSERT INTO users(name, created_at) VALUES (?, ?)\", \"john\", time.Now())\\n if err != nil {\\n  t.Errorf(\"error \\'%s\\' was not expected, while inserting a row\", err)\\n }\\n\\n if err := mock.ExpectationsWereMet(); err != nil {\\n  t.Errorf(\"there were unfulfilled expectations: %s\", err)\\n }\\n}\\nIt only asserts that argument is of time.Time type.\\nRun tests\\ngo test -race\\nChange Log\\n2019-04-06 - added functionality to mock a sql MetaData request\\n2019-02-13 - added go.mod removed the references and suggestions using gopkg.in.\\n2018-12-11 - added expectation of Rows to be closed, while mocking expected query.\\n2018-12-11 - introduced an option to provide QueryMatcher in order to customize SQL query matching.\\n2017-09-01 - it is now possible to expect that prepared statement will be closed, using ExpectedPrepare.WillBeClosed.\\n2017-02-09 - implemented support for go1.8 features. Rows interface was changed to struct but contains all methods as before and should maintain backwards compatibility. ExpectedQuery.WillReturnRows may now accept multiple row sets.\\n2016-11-02 - db.Prepare() was not validating expected prepare SQL query. It should still be validated even if Exec or Query is not executed on that prepared statement.\\n2016-02-23 - added sqlmock.AnyArg() function to provide any kind of argument matcher.\\n2016-02-23 - convert expected arguments to driver.Value as natural driver does, the change may affect time.Time comparison and will be stricter. See issue.\\n2015-08-27 - v1 api change, concurrency support, all known issues fixed.\\n2014-08-16 instead of panic during reflect type mismatch when comparing query arguments - now return error\\n2014-08-14 added sqlmock.NewErrorResult which gives an option to return driver.Result with errors for interface methods, see issue\\n2014-05-29 allow to match arguments in more sophisticated ways, by providing an sqlmock.Argument interface\\n2014-04-21 introduce sqlmock.New() to open a mock database connection for tests. This method calls sql.DB.Ping to ensure that connection is open, see issue. This way on Close it will surely assert if all expectations are met, even if database was not triggered at all. The old way is still available, but it is advisable to call db.Ping manually before asserting with db.Close.\\n2014-02-14 RowsFromCSVString is now a part of Rows interface named as FromCSVString. It has changed to allow more ways to construct rows and to easily extend this API in future. See issue 1 RowsFromCSVString is deprecated and will be removed in future\\nContributions\\nFeel free to open a pull request. Note, if you wish to contribute an extension to public (exported methods or types) - please open an issue before, to discuss whether these changes can be accepted.

       " 'MongoDB Go Driver\\nThe MongoDB supported driver for Go.\\nRequirements\\nInstallation\\nUsage\\nBugs / Feature Reporting\\nTesting / Development\\nContinuous Integration\\nLicense\\nRequirements\\nGo 1.10 or higher. We aim to support the latest supported versions of go.\\nMongoDB 2.6 and higher.\\nInstallation\\nThe recommended way to get started using the MongoDB Go driver is by using go modules to install the dependency in your project. This can be done either by importing packages from go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver and having the build step install the dependency or by explicitly running\\ngo get go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo\\nWhen using a version of Go that does not support modules, the driver can be installed using dep by running\\ndep ensure -add \"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo\"\\nUsage\\nTo get started with the driver, import the mongo package and create a mongo.Client with the Connect function:\\nimport (\\n    \"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo\"\\n    \"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo/options\"\\n    \"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo/readpref\"\\n)\\n\\nctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)\\ndefer cancel()\\nclient, err := mongo.Connect(ctx, options.Client().ApplyURI(\"mongodb://localhost:27017\"))\\nMake sure to defer a call to Disconnect after instantiating your client:\\ndefer func() {\\n    if err = client.Disconnect(ctx); err != nil {\\n        panic(err)\\n    }\\n}()\\nFor more advanced configuration and authentication, see the documentation for mongo.Connect.\\nCalling Connect does not block for server discovery. If you wish to know if a MongoDB server has been found and connected to, use the Ping method:\\nctx, cancel = context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Second)\\ndefer cancel()\\nerr = client.Ping(ctx, readpref.Primary())\\nTo insert a document into a collection, first retrieve a Database and then Collection instance from the Client:\\ncollection := client.Database(\"testing\").Collection(\"numbers\")\\nThe Collection instance can then be used to insert documents:\\nctx, cancel = context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)\\ndefer cancel()\\nres, err := collection.InsertOne(ctx, bson.D{{\"name\", \"pi\"}, {\"value\", 3.14159}})\\nid := res.InsertedID\\nTo use bson.D, you will need to add \"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson\" to your imports.\\nYour import statement should now look like this:\\nimport (\\n    \"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson\"\\n    \"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo\"\\n    \"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo/options\"\\n    \"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo/readpref\"\\n)\\nSeveral query methods return a cursor, which can be used like this:\\nctx, cancel = context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 30*time.Second)\\ndefer cancel()\\ncur, err := collection.Find(ctx, bson.D{})\\nif err != nil { log.Fatal(err) }\\ndefer cur.Close(ctx)\\nfor cur.Next(ctx) {\\n   var result bson.D\\n   err := cur.Decode(&result)\\n   if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) }\\n   // do something with result....\\n}\\nif err := cur.Err(); err != nil {\\n  log.Fatal(err)\\n}\\nFor methods that return a single item, a SingleResult instance is returned:\\nvar result struct {\\n    Value float64\\n}\\nfilter := bson.D{{\"name\", \"pi\"}}\\nctx, cancel = context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)\\ndefer cancel()\\nerr = collection.FindOne(ctx, filter).Decode(&result)\\nif err != nil {\\n    log.Fatal(err)\\n}\\n// Do something with result...\\nAdditional examples and documentation can be found under the examples directory and on the MongoDB Documentation website.\\nFeedback\\nFor help with the driver, please post in the MongoDB Community Forums.\\nNew features and bugs can be reported on jira: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/GODRIVER\\nTesting / Development\\nThe driver tests can be run against several database configurations. The most simple configuration is a standalone mongod with no auth, no ssl, and no compression. To run these basic driver tests, make sure a standalone MongoDB server instance is running at localhost:27017. To run the tests, you can run make (on Windows, run nmake). This will run coverage, run go-lint, run go-vet, and build the examples.\\nTesting Different Topologies\\nTo test a replica set or sharded cluster, set MONGODB_URI=\"<connection-string>\" for the make command. For example, for a local replica set named rs1 comprised of three nodes on ports 27017, 27018, and 27019:\\nMONGODB_URI=\"mongodb://localhost:27017,localhost:27018,localhost:27019/?replicaSet=rs1\" make\\nTesting Auth and TLS\\nTo test authentication and TLS, first set up a MongoDB cluster with auth and TLS configured. Testing authentication requires a user with the root role on the admin database. The Go Driver repository comes with example certificates in the data/certificates directory. These certs can be used for testing. Here is an example command that would run a mongod with TLS correctly configured for tests:\\nmongod \\\\\\n--auth \\\\\\n--tlsMode requireTLS \\\\\\n--tlsCertificateKeyFile $(pwd)/data/certificates/server.pem \\\\\\n--tlsCAFile $(pwd)/data/certificates/ca.pem \\\\\\n--tlsAllowInvalidCertificates\\nTo run the tests with make, set MONGO_GO_DRIVER_CA_FILE to the location of the CA file used by the database, set MONGODB_URI to the connection string of the server, set AUTH=auth, and set SSL=ssl. For example:\\nAUTH=auth SSL=ssl MONGO_GO_DRIVER_CA_FILE=$(pwd)/data/certificates/ca.pem  MONGODB_URI=\"mongodb://user:password@localhost:27017/?authSource=admin\" make\\nNotes:\\nThe --tlsAllowInvalidCertificates flag is required on the server for the test suite to work correctly.\\nThe test suite requires the auth database to be set with ?authSource=admin, not /admin.\\nTesting Compression\\nThe MongoDB Go Driver supports wire protocol compression using Snappy, zLib, or zstd. To run tests with wire protocol compression, set MONGO_GO_DRIVER_COMPRESSOR to snappy, zlib, or zstd. For example:\\nMONGO_GO_DRIVER_COMPRESSOR=snappy make\\nEnsure the --networkMessageCompressors flag on mongod or mongos includes zlib if testing zLib compression.\\nContribution\\nCheck out the project page for tickets that need completing. See our contribution guidelines for details.\\nContinuous Integration\\nCommits to master are run automatically on evergreen.\\nThanks and Acknowledgement\\n@ashleymcnamara - Mongo Gopher Artwork\\nLicense\\nThe MongoDB Go Driver is licensed under the Apache License.',\n",
